# MD_Food_App
Developing a mobile application in React Native, using Expo

To start, open the terminal and navigate to the code folder, and run the "npm start" command (without the quotation marks). 
Using a mobile device with Expo Go installed, scan the generated QR code, or press "a" on your keyboard to start on an Andoird emulator.

Otherwise, open https://snack.expo.dev/@shadowwinter/md_food_app for the latest build.
